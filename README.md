    useLocalDatabase=true

    //local database config
    url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/health-lanka
    username=root
    password=yourpassword
    

## Database Setup

2.  Open your MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench or command line).
    
3. Import the database dump.

## Usage

*   Run the project from Eclipse.
    
*   The main interface will launch, allowing login and access to hospital management modules.
    

## Dependencies

*   Java SE 8 or higher
    
*   Eclipse IDE
    
*   MySQL Server
    
*   JDBC Connector (added to project libraries)
